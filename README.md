# Getting Started with React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<ol>
  <li> First, download and unzip the project, or run a `git clone` on the repository. </li>
  <li> Once you have the project locally, you'll have to do a `npm install` or `yarn install`, in the project directory.</li>
  <li> After you've installed the necessary modules by following the step above, you can: </li>
  
### `yarn start` or `npm start`
  This runs the app in development mode.\
Just open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn build` or `npm build`

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
This makes the app ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

# Description
  
<b>Challenge goal:</b> The purpose of this challenge is to give a general idea of how React works and how it can be used to create simple reactive applications. I've implemented a simplified version of Hapu’s ‘Become a Nanny Share Host’ view. The concepts that were applied are:

<ul>
  <li>JSX;</li>
  <li>Components, props and state;</li>
  <li>Lifecycle Methods;</li>
  <li>Responsive design with CSS media-queries;</li>
  <li>API calls;</li>
  <li>Error handling;</li>
  <li>SEO & accessibility;</li>
  <li>A/B tests;</li>
  <li>Production builds.</li>
 </ul>
 
 ### A/B tests
 When running the app, you may end up seeing one of the two following screens:
 <ul>
  <li> This is the <b> original prototype design version. <img src="https://github.com/luizamedeiros/hapu-nanny-share-remake-challenge/blob/main/public/Screenshots/designversion.png"/> </li>
  </b>
  <li> This is the <b> alternative version, used for the A/B test. </b> <img src="https://github.com/luizamedeiros/hapu-nanny-share-remake-challenge/blob/main/public/Screenshots/testversion.png"/></li> </ul>
   <br>
  <b> Since these screens are persistent for users, once you run the project, there's a chance that the screen you first get is the screen you'll always see! This is done on purpose so that the user always has the most consistent experience possible. If for some reason you'd like to see the other screen, all you have to do is clear your browser storage session, and you should be good to go. </b>
