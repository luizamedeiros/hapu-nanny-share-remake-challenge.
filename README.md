# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
After downloading the project, in the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start` or `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build` or `npm build`

This builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

# Description

  <li>API calls;</li>
  <li>Error handling;</li>
  <li>Loading states;</li>
  <li>SEO & accessibility;</li>
  <li>A/B tests;</li>
  <li>Production builds.</li>
 </ul>
 ### A/B tests
 When running the app, you may end up seeing one of the two following screens:
